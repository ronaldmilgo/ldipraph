/**
 * A track is a sequence of segments s_0, ..., s_{n-1}, where each segment
 * s_i is a sequence of track points t_i,0, ..., t_i,{n_i-1}, with each track
 * point recording the latitude, longitude, and time of some object
 * as it travels along its path.  Track points within a single segment
 * are recorded in order of strictly increasing time (so the time of
 * t_i_j will be strictly less than the time of t_i_{j+1} for two adjacent
 * track points in any segment), and segments are ordered so that the time
 * of the last track point in one segment is strictly less than the time
 * of the first track point in the next segment (so the time of t_i_{n_i-1}
 * i strictly less than the time of t_{i+1}_0).  There is always at
 * one segment, and only the last segment can be empty.
 *
 * Tracks have operations to add track points to the end of the current
 * (last) segment, start a new segment, merge segments by concatenating
 * a range of segments together, and query individual segments and points.

 * represents an area bounded by two circles of latitude and two
 * meridians of longitude.  The circle of latitude bounding the top of
 * the top row is the northernmost (highest) latitude of any
 * track point in the given track.  The meridian bounding the left of
 * the first column is the western edge of the smallest spherical
 * wedge bounded by two meridians that contains all the points in the
 * track (the "western edge" for a nontrivial wedge being the one
 * that, when you move east from it along the equator, you stay in the
 * wedge).  When there are multiple such wedges, choose the one with
 * the lowest normalized (adjusted to the range -180 (inclusive) to
 * 180 (exclusive)) longitude of the western edge.  The
 * distance (in degrees) between the bounds of adjacent
 * rows and columns is given by the last two
 * parameters.  The heat map will have just enough rows and just
 * enough columns so that all points in the track fall into some cell.
 * The value in each entry in the heatmap is the number of track points
 * located in the corresponding cell.  If a track point is on the
 * border of two or more cells then it is counted in the bottommost
 * and rightmost cell it is on the border of, except the southernmost row
 * and easternmost column include their southern and eastern border
 * respectively, and neither will contain only points on their
 * northern or western border.  If the eastermost cells
 * have wrapped around to overlap the westernmost cells then the
 * points that belong to both are placed in the westernmost cells.
 * If there are no track points in the track then the function
 * creates a 1x1 heatmap with the single element having a value of 0.
 * The caller takes ownership of the returned array (both the
 * array of rows and the arrays for each individual row; the caller
 * must ensure that those arrays are eventually freed).
